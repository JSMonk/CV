Experience
----------

**The Most Recent Work Experience:**

I worked (from September 2019 to May 2020) at [Wrike Company](https://www.wrike.com/) in a new Research and Development Team. 

I and my teammates (other 2 people) built development analytic process and developed infrastructure for the process from scratch.

My responsibilities areas in the work were:

* Analysis platform.

* Knowledgebase (an API which store project attributes).

* DX Improvement Tools (editor extensions, GitLab webhooks, etc)

We already got results: defined separated responsibility area for our teams, which improved the development process (fast search and communication with code owner) and more productive replacing of deprecated technologies from the product.

**Other Recent Job I Had**

* [HellYeah](https://hy.dev/) Research Department.
  I worked on cryptography libraries related to digital signatures and private cryptocurrencies clients with high-level safety.
  As a result of research, I developed zero-dependency cryptocurrencies clients, which currently used in private projects(NDA).

* [WookieeLabs](https://www.upwork.com/o/companies/~019c0fc838498df613/). 
  [My Upwork profile at the company](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01743ab09e751efe1c/). I worked at different outsource projects as a software engineer: [Unicef Primero](https://www.primero.org/), [Crossover Health](https://crossoverhealth.com/), [doc.ai](https://doc.ai/), [NextLead](https://www.nextlead.io/).


Technical Skills
--------------------

**"Primary" Technologies**

I commonly work with `JavaScript` ecosystem.

Especially, I worked a lot with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and popular backend frameworks like ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/ru/), [Koa](https://koajs.com/), [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/)) at the backend side.

At the backend, I used different DB solutions: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

Additionally, I worked a lot with popular front-end frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) too) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

And of course, I worked with popular static type solutions for JavaScript: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow.js](https://flow.org/).

**"Secondary" Technologies**

I worked with `C/C++` and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ecosystem, especially when I was working with cryptography and cryptocurrencies.

Also, I worked with [Dart Language](https://dart.dev/) and his ecosystem, when I was working in [Wrike Company](https://www.wrike.com/).

At the start of my programming career, I worked with `C#` and `.NET`, especially, with `.NET MVC` and `.NET Web API`.

And when I was a freelancer with pure [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/ru/) ([RoR](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/)).

**"Basic Knowledge" Technologies**

In my spare time, I really like to work with: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/), [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/)/[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Golang](https://golang.org/). Additionally, I basically know [Java](https://www.java.com), [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/), [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Open Source
--------------------

**My Own**

* [Hegel](https://github.com/JSMonk/hegel) - a static type checker for JavaScript with high-level type inference (Hindley-Milner algorithm) and a strong type system.

* [sweet-monads](https://github.com/JSMonk/sweet-monads) - zero-dependency monads for JavaScript.

**In which I make significant changes**

* [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) - the most popular Node.js file watcher. The 3.0.0 version was developed on my own.

* [readdirp](https://github.com/paulmillr/readdirp) - recursive `readdir` with additional goodies (15,603,219 downloads per week). The 3.0.0 version was developed on my own.

* [noble-ripemd160](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ripemd160) - a cryptography hash function.

* [noble-ed25519](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519) - a digital signature library based at ed15519 schema.

* [noble-secp256k1](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1) - a digital signature library based at secp256k1 schema.

* [noble-bls12-381](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-bls12-381) - a digital signature library based at noble12-381 schema.

> Initially, noble projects were developed by me and after were handed over to [Paul Miller](https://github.com/paulmillr):

Other
----------------------------------------

* I teach students at [JavaScript.Ninja Project](http://javascript.ninja/)

* I and my friend make a Russian-language podcast [UnderJS](https://underjs.ru/) about JavaScript and Compilers.

* I also one of the organizers one of the largest conference in Russian-language countries [HolyJS](https://holyjs.ru/)
